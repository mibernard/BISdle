# Next Steps for Deployment

## ✅ What's Done

Your caching system is **fully implemented and ready to deploy**!

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable
In your Vercel project dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add: `RIOT_API_KEY` = `your_riot_api_key_here`
3. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
# From your project directory
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test
Visit your deployed site and verify it works!

## ✅ That's It!

Your caching will work automatically. The system will:
- Cache data for 24 hours
- Serve unlimited users from cache
- Only make 1 API call per day
- Handle errors gracefully

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements (Later)

### If you want even better persistence:

**Add Vercel KV** (5 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Install package
npm install @vercel/kv

# 2. In Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Create KV Database
# 3. Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

**Add Cron Job** (2 minutes):
```bash
# 1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
#    Add: CRON_SECRET = any_random_string
# 2. Redeploy (vercel.json already configured)
vercel --prod
```

- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Detailed technical docs
- **`CACHING_SUMMARY.md`** - How the caching works

## ⚠️ Important: Production API Key

Your current Riot API key expires every 24 hours (development key).

**For production**:
1. Go to https://developer.riotgames.com/
2. Apply for a **Production API Key**
3. Update the `RIOT_API_KEY` in Vercel
4. Production keys don't expire!

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Deployment

### First User Visit:
- Takes 2-3 seconds (fetching from Riot API)
- Data is cached

### All Other Visits (next 24 hours):
- Takes 50-100ms (from cache)
- No API calls
- Unlimited users supported

### After 24 Hours:
- Cache automatically refreshes
- Cycle repeats

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch data"
**Fix**: Check that `RIOT_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables

### Issue: Data seems old
**Fix**: This is normal - cache refreshes every 24 hours by design

### Issue: Still getting rate limited
**Fix**: 
1. Check Vercel logs to verify caching is working
2. Make sure you deployed the latest code
3. Consider adding Vercel KV for better persistence

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Just run `vercel --prod` and your caching system will handle everything automatically!
